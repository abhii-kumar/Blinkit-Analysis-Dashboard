This project focuses on building a complete business analytics dashboard for Blinkit.

The dataset was collected from Kaggle, using publicly available real-world data.

Raw data was gathered in multiple formats (CSV/Excel) for analysis.

Data cleaning was performed to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Outliers were detected and treated using statistical methods.

Data transformation and shaping were done using Excel Power Query.

Structured data modeling was applied for efficient analysis.

SQL was used for data extraction, filtering, and aggregation.

Feature engineering was applied to create meaningful metrics and KPIs.

Key business indicators like revenue, sales, profit, and order volume were derived.

Data visualization was performed using Power BI.

Interactive dashboards were created with slicers and filters.

Dynamic charts and KPI cards were designed for real-time insights.

Category-wise and city-wise performance analysis was included.

Customer behavior and demand patterns were visualized.

Trend analysis (daily, monthly, yearly) was implemented.

The project enables data-driven business decision-making.

It supports inventory planning and demand forecasting.

The dashboard improves operational efficiency and business strategy.
